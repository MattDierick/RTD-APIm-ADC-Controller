Step 1 - Deploy Arcadia App2 with a CI/CD pipeline like a DevOps
****************************************************************

#. In Gitlab, click on Administrator / Arcadia-App2
   
   #. Click on file ``deploy``
   #. Click ``edit`` and make a modification - like YES !!!!!
   #. Click ``Commit changes``

   .. note :: At this moment, you simulate a commit like a DevOps. This ``commit`` will trigger a ``webhook`` to ``Jenkins``, so that Jenkins execute a ``pipeline``.
