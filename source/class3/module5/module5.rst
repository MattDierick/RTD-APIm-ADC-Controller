Module 5 - Developer Portal
###########################

.. note :: If you remember, we deployed 3 instances. One for the WebApp, one for the APIs and another one for the DevPortal. We will use the latest in this lab.

When we uploaded the OAS3 file, this file included the API documentation as well. There is only one step to publish the documentation into the DevPortal instance.

Step 1 - Assign the DevPortal tag to the DevPortal instance
***********************************************************

The controller needs to know which instance to use to push the Developer Portal into it. To do so, we have to add a ``tag`` to this instance. We will use the instance ``devportal``

#. In the controller GUI, click on ``Infrastructure`` > ``Instances`` > ``Graphs``
#. Select the ``devportal`` instance and click on the ``gear`` icon close to the name of the instance

#. Select or enter ``devportal`` in the tag field, lowercase

      :scale: 50%

#. Click ``save``

   .. note :: We need to ``force`` to push the API configuration to the GW in order to push the documentation to the DepPortal


Step 2 - Force a push
*********************

#. In ``Services`` > ``APIs`` > ``API Definitions``
#. Edit your ``Publish API`` and click on ``submit``

      :scale: 50%


Step 3 - Navigate to the Developer Portal
*****************************************

#. In the Jumphost, open ``Chrome``
#. Click on the ``Dev Portal APIm`` bookmark

#. Click on the published API doc
#. Navigate to the ``endpoints``

.. note :: Navigate in the Developer Portal. As you can notice, this has been populated automatically thanks to the OAS file. As a reminder, the OAS file looks like that (this is an extract for the ``buy stock`` API.
